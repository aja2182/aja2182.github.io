            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a sociologist focusing broadly on health and medicine, policy, and inequality. Currently, I am an inaugural postdoctoral research fellow with the Health Evaluation & Analytics (HEAL) Lab at NYU Langoneâ€™s Department of Population Health and the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. More on this joint initiative can be found here. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, I am committed to improving the health and well-being of everyday New Yorkers. </p>
