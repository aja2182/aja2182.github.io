            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a sociologist focusing broadly on health and medicine, policy, and inequality. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Health Evaluation & Analytics (HEAL) Lab at NYU Langone’s Department of Population Health and the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. More on this joint initiative can be found here. Born and raised in Coney Island, I am personally committed to improving the health and well-being of everyday New Yorkers. </p>

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>

    <p> My research brings together the sociology of health and medicine, punishment and social control, stratification and inequality, and comparative social policy. I'm interested in how people use power, judgment, and authority over themselves and others. I'm particularly drawn to substance use and mental health because these fields reveal historically conflicting and changing views on selfhood––medical, moral, and political––which influence how we respond to these issues as a society. </p>
