            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a sociologist of health and medicine, policy, and inequality. I received a Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University in 2023 and currently a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Grossman Department of Population Health and NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Serviceâ€”a joint initiative aimed at advancing research on the state and quality of substance and mental health treatment. I was born and raised in Coney Island, just steps from the iconic amusement park, and I now find myself indefinitely on vacation in Manhattan. </p>

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>

    <p> My current work focuses on three key areas of research: (1) effects of social policies on substance and mental health treatment, (2)  clinical and patient perspectives on treatment and recovery, and (3)  psychiatry, neuroscience, and social dynamics (e.g., status, mobility, closure).  More on my current and past research projects can be found here. </p>
