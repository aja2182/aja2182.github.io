            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a sociologist focusing broadly on health and medicine, policy, and inequality. Currently, I am an inaugural postdoctoral research fellow with the Health Evaluation & Analytics (HEAL) Lab at NYU Langoneâ€™s Department of Population Health and the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. More on this joint initiative can be found here. My day-to-day work consists of analyzing large administrative datasets (e.g., treatment registries, Medicaid claims), mentoring physician scientists in training, working with research coordinators to conduct interview and focus group studies with patients and providers, and relentlessly turning tables into graphs.
        Much of this work is part of a NIDA-funded parent study examining the individual, interpersonal, and structural forces that shape the trajectories and outcomes of substance use treatment among young adults statewide (PI: C. Neighbors, R01DA057267-01).  </p>
