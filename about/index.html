            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> I’m Josh Aleksanyan, a sociologist who works in a broad and interdisciplinary field that draws on epidemiology, health services research, and comparative social policy. I received my Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University in 2023. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow with the Health Evaluation and Analytics (HEAL) Lab, a joint initiative of NYU Langone’s Department of Population Health and NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Through a unique partnership with public health and government agencies, my current research focuses on improving access, quality, and outcomes of substance use and mental health treatment, particularly for young people, pregnant women, and individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>

    <p> My current work focuses on three key areas of research: (1) effects of social policies on substance use treatment, (2)  provider and patient perspectives on treatment and recovery, and (3) medicine and social dynamics (e.g., identity, status, mobility, closure).  More on my current and past research projects can be found here. </p>
