            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> I am a sociologist specializing in health and medicine, policy, and inequality. I received my Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University in 2023 and am currently a postdoctoral fellow with the Health Evaluation and Analytics (HEAL) Lab in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and NYU Wagner School of Public Service. Through a unique partnership with state regulatory agencies, my work focuses on advancing research to assess and improve the quality 
                of substance use and mental health treatment systems.

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>

    <p> My current work focuses on three key areas of research: (1) effects of social policies on substance and mental health treatment, (2)  provider and patient experiences and perspectives on treatment and recovery, and (3) psychiatry, neuroscience, and social dynamics (e.g., status, mobility, closure).  More on my current and past research projects can be found here. </p>
