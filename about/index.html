            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a sociologist focusing broadly on health and medicine, policy, and inequality. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Health Evaluation & Analytics (HEAL) Lab at NYU Langone’s Department of Population Health and the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. More on this joint initiative can be found here. Born and raised in Coney Island, I am personally committed to improving the health and well-being of everyday New Yorkers. </p>

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>

    <p> My research brings together the sociology of health and medicine, punishment and social control, stratification and inequality, and comparative social policy. I'm interested in how people use power, judgment, and authority over themselves and others. I'm particularly drawn to substance use and mental health because these fields reveal conflicting and changing views on selfhood, both moral and medical, which influence how we respond to these issues </p>

    <p>I have recently begun to turn my focus to the relationship between psychiatry and social status, using the rise of adult ADHD diagnoses and pharmacotherapy as a case study to explore broader questions surrounding social mobility in the contemporary U.S., and how this process shapes and is shaped by practices of social closure. These practices include drawing boundaries of moral and medical judgment, constructing neurochemical identities, and building online communities using ADHD media. Relatedly, along with anthropologist Lee Gensler, we are also exploring the emergence of the category “neurodivergent,” focusing on the cognitive tools and techniques community members use to describe and legitimate the category. </p>
